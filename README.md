**Cloud Resume Challenge AWS**

(I am not an AWS expert, and do not claim to be)

This is my attempt at the AWS cloud resume challenge. I have just finished my cloud computing degree at WGU and used the basis of this project as my Capstone project for WGU.
The cloud resume challenge helped me to get more hands on experience with AWS services and increased my confidence with working with AWS as a whole. 

**HTML & CSS** - Used HTML and CSS knowledge to personalize this resume. You can find the raw version that I made from scratch here

**AWS S3/CloudFront** - Used AWS S3 buckets in order to store the resume website file and restrict public access. Utilized cloudfront to access the file and only allow for HTTPS connections. Created SSL certificate for my domain using AWS ACM.

**DynamoDB/Lambda** - Created a table in DynamoDB to record the view count and wrote a Lambda function in python to call from/update the table.

**JavaScript/Git** - Wrote a few lines of JavaScript to display the updated view count pulled from the Lambda API, connected frontend to GitHub repository for source control.
